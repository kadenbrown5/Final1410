A summary of your ultimate aspiration for the project:

The ultimate goal of the project was to create a game

A summary of why the project is interesting to you:

This interested me because I wanted to see if I could actually create somethings functional

A summary of what portion of the project you actually attempted and completed for this submission:

I attempted to create a game from start to finish however I had some health problems and only ended up creating the base for the game. I did create a great base structure that I could have expanded upon.

A reflection on what you learned from the project:

I learned that building things can be tough however if you take your time and bulid a structure you can easily grow and expand things.

Classes
I used multiple classes in the base game class and each of the inherited classes in the interfaces

Inheritance and polymorphism
I used inheritence and polymorphism in the Characters and Items I broke down the Interface into smaller classes which all have edited data types and references in the inherited classes

Fields and Properties
I use fields and properties in all of my classes and interfaces

Interfaces
I use two interfaces in the Icharacters and the IITems

Enum
I use the enum in the Game class called TooMuch and used it like a bool

Null
I use null by creating a program that has no way of null

threads
I use thread sleeper for the text printer in the begining of the program

Execptions
I created the program in a way that there can be no exeption thrown making it work well
